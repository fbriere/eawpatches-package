eawpatches for Debian
---------------------

To configure TiMidity++ to use these patches, simply add the following line
to /etc/timidity.cfg:

  source /etc/timidity/eawpatches.cfg

If you have installed the freepats package, you may need to remove (or
comment out) the "source /etc/timidity/freepats.cfg" line.
