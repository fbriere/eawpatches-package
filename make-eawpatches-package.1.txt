NAME
----
make-eawpatches-package - builds an eawpatches Debian package

SYNOPSIS
--------
*make-eawpatches-package* ['options' ...] ['URL' | 'filename']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Creates a Debian package from an eawpatches archive file.

By default, the packager will attempt to download the archive file from
several possible locations.  You can instead provide a specific 'URL' to
download from, or a local 'filename'.  Both *.tar.gz* and *.zip* versions
are supported (the latter only if the *unzip* command is available).

Upon success, the resulting *eawpatches* package will be located in the
current directory.

OPTIONS
-------
*--fullname* 'name'::
	Use 'name' as full name in the package's Maintainer field.  Defaults
	to the *DEBFULLNAME* or *NAME* environment variable if set, or the
	local user's name in '/etc/passwd' otherwise.  (*--help* will display
	the default value.)

*--email* 'email'::
	Use 'email' as email address in the package's Maintainer field.
	Defaults to the *DEBEMAIL* or *EMAIL* environment variable if set, or
	"'local-user'@'hostname'" otherwise.  (*--help* will display the
	default value.)

*--revision-append* 'string'::
	Append 'string' to the Debian revision number.  This defaults to
	"+local", to mark this package as being locally generated, instead of
	fetched from a repository.
	+
	'string' may contain only alphanumerics and the characters + . ~ (plus,
	full stop, tilde).

*--compress-type* 'type'::
	Specify which compression type to use when building the package.
	Allowed values are 'gzip', 'xz', 'bzip2', 'lzma', and 'none' (default
	is 'gzip').

*--compress-level* 'level'::
	Specify which compression level to use when building the package.
	See the *dpkg-deb*(1) manpage for allowed and default values.

*--no-ftp*::
	Do not attempt to download files via FTP.

*--list-urls*::
	Display the list of URLs which will be used by default if no 'URL' or
	'filename' is provided on the command-line.  They will be tried one by
	one in random order, up until the archive file is successfully
	downloaded or the URL list is exhausted.

*--force*::
	Override safety checks.

*--help*::
	Display a brief help message.

*--version*::
	Display *make-eawpatches-package* version information.
